[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%2336BCF7&duration=4000&center=true&lines=C%2B%2B+%7C+Problem+Solving)](https://git.io/typing-svg)<br />

This repository contains notes and practice files from the [C++ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-deep-dive/) by Mr Abdul Bari.
Efforts were made to make the files as readable as possible, by Commenting the code and adding explanations still there is room for improvement.

## Description

The course addresses the requisite basic concepts of [C++ programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and was hence underwent in order to strengthen and formalize what I had known beforehand

For other Advanced Concepts and practice problems, I have created
#### [Data Structures and Algorithms Repository[In progress]](https://github.com/parasguglani1/DSA_Practice)
#### [Additional Problems in competitive programming](https://github.com/parasguglani1/competitive_coding)
